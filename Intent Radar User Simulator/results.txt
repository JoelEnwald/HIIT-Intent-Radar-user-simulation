Hence the volume of the fiber cells that make up the bulk of the lens needs to be tightly regulated if lens transparency is to be preserved. While it has long been appreciated that the lens can regulate its volume when placed in anisosmotic solutions, recent work suggests that the lens also actively maintains its volume under steady-state conditions. Furthermore, the process of fiber cell elongation necessitates that differentiating fiber cells dramatically increase their volume in response to growth factors. The cellular transport mechanisms that mediate the regulation of fiber cell volume in the lens cortex are only just beginning to beelucidated. In this region, fiber cells are continuously undergoing a process of differentiation that creates an inherent gradient of cells at different stages of elongation. These cells express different complements of transport proteins involved in volume regulation. In addition, transport processes at different depths into the lens are differentially influenced by electrochemical gradients that alter with distance into the lens. Taken together, our work suggests that the lens has spatially distinct ion influx and efflux pathways that interact to control its steady-state volume, its response to hypotonic swelling, and the elongation of differentiating fibers. Based on this work, we present a model which may explain the unique damage phenotype observed in diabetic cataract, in terms of the uncoupling or dysregulation of these ion influx and efflux pathways.

Powerful web writers of the first decade of the Web needed to be cautioned about usability and accessibility issues. As power shifts to web readers, they become capable of customizing web pages to their own tastes and purposes. This paper describes the development of Greasemonkey extension of the Firefox browser. Argument User scripting is a product of the development of the open source browser, and individual developers who wish to change webpages. The Greasemonkey extension of the Firefox browser permits web readers to write JavaScripts that (1) Change the look and feel of Web pages, (2) Change the functionality of web page controls, and (3) Facilitates Web page \"mashups\", hybrid web presentations composed of content from two or more web pages. The only naturally occurring limit to web page modificationmay be difficult Web page source code. Tools that shield Web readers from the complexity of HTML are being introduced. Conclusion The paradigm shift to Web readers, armed with powerful and easy-to-use tools for customizing Web pages heralds a new era of the Web.
